Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).


- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

  If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.
